# ETO-DNNSharp-Integration

This is a class library project that is used with DNNSharp API Endpoint and My Tokens. This assembly is accessed by a Razor script in My Tokens. 
The razor script calls 

`Eto.Parser.KeyContactParser.GetRelationshipsAsHtml("21448", "66", "https://example.com");` 

and is returned an HTML response that can be displayed on the page. This project can be expanded further to to parse other information from the ETO api.
